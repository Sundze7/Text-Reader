# Text-Reader
This app was developed using vanilla JS, CSS (bootstrap) and HTML.
 It receives input text from a user and reads the text. 
 The user is given the option to alter the pitch and rate (speed) of the voice which is reading the text. This voice is selected from a list of voices (with differnt accents). Explore the app by clicking the link in the About section (top-right corner) on this page. :)
